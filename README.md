# Color Identification Web Application

This is a Django-based web application that allows users to upload an image, which is then processed to identify the colors in the image.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Django REST framework

You can install Python and Django using pip:

```bash
pip install Django djangorestframework
```

Getting Started
Clone the repository or create a Django project with these files.

Configure your Django project settings (e.g., database settings).

Migrate the database:
```
python manage.py migrate
```
Run the development server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
API Endpoint
The application exposes an API endpoint for color identification.

Endpoint: /color-identification/
HTTP Method: POST
Request Parameter: image (file upload)
How It Works
The user uploads an image file to the /color-identification/ endpoint.

The image is saved to the media/ folder using Django's FileSystemStorage.

An instance of the UploadedImage model is created and saved to the database.

The process_image function is called to identify colors in the uploaded image.

The identified colors are returned in the response.

Example Usage
You can use this API to identify colors programmatically. Here's an example using Python's requests library:
```
import requests

url = 'http://localhost:8000/color-identification/'
files = {'image': ('your_image.jpg', open('your_image.jpg', 'rb'))}

response = requests.post(url, files=files)

if response.status_code == 200:
    identified_colors = response.json()
    print(f'Identified Colors: {identified_colors}')
else:
    print(f'Error: {response.json()}')
```
Frontend
The frontend of this application is available in the index.html template. You can customize the frontend to suit your needs.
